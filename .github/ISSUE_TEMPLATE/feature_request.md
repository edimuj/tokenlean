## Problem

What's the pain point? What workflow is inefficient today?

## Proposed solution

Describe the tool or feature. Include example usage:

```bash
tl-<name> <args>
```

## Token savings

How does this save tokens compared to the current approach?

```
Current approach: read entire file      → ~2,000 tokens
With this tool:   tl-<name> <args>      → ~200 tokens
```

## Alternatives considered

Any other ways to solve this?
